An archiving system project for a law firm that has 3 different types of users with corresponding abstractions

Product description:
As the world increasingly progresses towards a technology driven environment, the 
legal sector isn't to be left behind. In the past years, clients get to know about lawyers through 
recommendation and there would be no easy way to contact the lawyer and exchange 
information on a case other than direct contact. Work was slow and tedious as paperwork piled 
up and had to be marked and filed so that it could be referred later on. The basis of this project 
is to bridge the technology gap between the lawyers and clients in India. Firms that deal with 
legal services will most likely handle huge quantities of inventory and have to make sure that 
these files are readily available at a moment’s notice. Records kept on paper in files are no 
longer feasible. Details of clients and employees, information on cases and hearings etc thus 
need a better mode of management. It has therefore become necessary for these firms to use a 
way which will securely handle this massive data and readily avail it to over one person at a 
time, quickly and instantly, even though they are in different locations. Our project “Law Firm 
Management Website” aims to provide the client and employees of a law firm with an easy to 
access, secure and direct means of accessing the resources of a law firm.
